# Feature

Why Include `language-configuration.json` or `just.tmLanguage.json`?

- Optional Enhancements: If you plan to add syntax highlighting or other language features, these files are necessary.
- Complete Language Support: If no other extension provides support for just files, you may want to include these files for a better user experience.

If youâ€™re certain your formatter is the only feature you want to provide, you can omit them entirely!
